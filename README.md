# Record-Store-Bot
Example bot for the Voice-Over-IP application Discord.
This particular bot is a copy of a bot I made that is part of a larger application for a school project. It hits a web API I wrote for the school project.

This is a barebones implementation. There are better ways to write bots using Discord.Net. This is just a simple example.
